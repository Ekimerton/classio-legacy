        <h1 class='text-center mb-5'> <a href="{{url_for('main.home')}}"> classio</a> â€¢ About </h1>
        <p>
            <font size="+0"> If you are confused about classio, please refer to the <a href="{{url_for('main.faq')}}">
                    FAQ
                </a> page.

        <h3> Intro </h3>
        <p>
            <font size="+0">
                Classio was made because I found myself struggling every year, putting off class selection for as long
                as I could. It was an easy process, but very tedious. Tedious work and computers are a no brainer.
            </font>
        </p>
        <h3> Scraping </h3>
        <p>
            <font size="+0">
                My first problem was having to scrape the class times from the university's master list. For UBC, I
                found a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/aupojv/ubc_courses_api/"> student-made API</a>,
                and used that.
                </br>
                </br>
                For Waterloo there was an API, but it was under maintenance. They did have a <a
                    href="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infocour/CIR/SA/under.html"> database of all the class times</a>,
                so I scraped that using requests and BeautifulSoup.
                </br>
                </br>
                Queen's was the school I scraped first, and it was also the hardest. The course information is displayed
                using javascript, so I had to use Selenium. Unlike the other two, classes have to scraped before the
                query. When you type a query for Waterloo or UBC, that class' information is pulled in real time. For
                Queen's it's pulled from a local database, which gets filled every time I run the Queen's scrape.
            </font>
        </p>
        <h3> Optimizing </h3>
        <p>
            <font size="+0">
                Once all the class times are pulled, the sections are separated into two categories: constant and
                variable. Constant sections have only one option (eg: A class has lectures at only one time), whereas
                variable sections present a list of different times. A permutation of all possible times is generated by
                going through each combination of variable times.
                </br>
                </br>
                Once combinations are generated, a sweep is made to eliminate any that have conflicting times.
                Obviously, a timetable with conflicting times shouldn't be shown to the user.
                </br>
                </br>
                A final pass is made through the remaining timetables to generate a score, as well as other useful
                information. The final result of the optimization is a list of timetables, sorted by score.
            </font>
        </p>
        <h3> Front-end </h3>
        <p>
            <font size="+0">
                The front-end is made with Bootstrap and jQuery. The tech behind it isn't interesting at all, as it is
                just simple code.
